# My Love-Hate Relationship With Sleep

I Love to sleep, I wish I could sleep as much as humanly possible. I can't.

I Hate to sleep, I wish I could stay awaks for as long as humanly possible. I can't.

Everyone needs to sleep, it's a physiological necessity. It winds us down and lets our main processing unit relax.
Sleep is ever the preffered state I would rather be in, as opposed to certain activities, like socializing and working.

You see, sleep for me is also a coping mechanism for my 2 decade long, on and off again Major Depression Disorder.
Sleep was an outlet from the nightmare which was living and dealing with myself and my surroundings during the day.
I couldn't wait for my daily obligations to end, whereupon I would rush home, lock myself in my room, waste what ever time was left
in the day on some mental distractions, and then go to sleep.

Around 2006-2007, I had my 'supersleep stage'. We would come back from our offices to the dorms around 17:30. 
Everyone would then go have dinner. I snuck hastily into the showers, 5 minutes and I was done. I jumped into bed and by 18:00 I was out, fast asleep. 
Skipped dinner, obviously, no one would notice anyway, and I slept for 12 to 13 hours straight. Night after night.
And when I woke up the next day, I cussed a bit about still living and not dying in my sleep, I put on my 'everything is ok' mask and started another day.

I'm not saying sleeping was the best thing, it was far from it, and I knew it. I just couldn't bring myself to staying up if there was no reason for me to do so.
I also have periods of intense, unsetlling, upsetting dreams. I had dreams where I was being haunted, I had dreams where I would continouosly fall from a high place.
I had dreams with recurring images and carracters, which one would build on the other to create a whole fanatasy world, which was the abruptly dissolved into the sound of my alarm clock ringing.

I sometimes had periods of no dreams at all. None. I would remember falling asleep, I would know that time is passing by, and I would wake up as if I time travelled into the future with no recollection of anything happenning. It was daunting, but eerily relaxing. 
But most of all, sleeping was, and to a degree stil is, a coping mechanism for my depression. When you don't want to live, sleeping is as close as you can get to dying.

I still take depression naps, when my brain is so overwhelmed, I need to shut off for a couple of hours. And boy, mixing these naps with medication can get trippy.

Sleep is the antithesis of a modern hecktic productive life.
There's so much more you can do with an extra waking hour when you put it to any other use but sleeping.

In the past 5 years, when my career progressed, there were several instances where I would fixate on a task and just stay up all night working. Usually at home. 
If my wife had caught me awake on my computer I would say that I cant sleep, or I'm coming to bed soon.
A couple of times I stayed up all night at work. Can't say I was very productive, it was usuaÄºy some monotonous or repeterive task I was too dumb to automate. 
It's funny in retrospect how I got praised for these types of jobs.
On a couple of occasions I was finalizing a class or course material, when the software decided to act up, and I spent the night thinking of workarounds.
Sure my procrastination was a key factor in me leaving the task for the last possible moment, but watching the sun rise, over a half built course, is one hell of an adrenaline rush. 

Nowadays, well, before my recent bout with major depressive dissorder, it was nighttime revenge procrastination. 
I would finish all my tasks for that evening, house chores, kids, and then just not go to sleep. 
I would sit on my computer and rummage through email, again, half bake some documents, doomscroll twitter, anything I can do to feed my mind with infotmation, or distractions. 
Im literally drafting these lines in a private signal message in kinda the same fashion. I just dont know why im not going to sleep.
As far as the most common diagnoses go, the not being able to fall asleep is largely due to stress.

Stress - that I would not be able to sleep.

Stress - from tha insignificant thing that happened during the day on which I am fixating now and overthinking my sleep away on it.

Stress - that one of my kids will need me, or that my wife will call me, so why bother going to sleep only to be rudely woken up in a short time?

Im too wired and anxious to sleep. Nevermind my famility not letting me sleep, I may get cold or hot, some annoying little sound will garner my attention, Same far away light will be just distracting enough for me do get up and turn it off. But mostly, im just sad to sleep, knowing that the past day was a waste of everyones time. I did not do anything productive, and tomorrow will be the same. Im too depressed to sleep, too depressed to stay up late, and way, waaaay too depressed to get up in the morning every single day
